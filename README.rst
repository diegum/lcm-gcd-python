LCM & CGD
=========

This simple Python project illustrates dynamic programming and memoization in the calculation of Least Common Multiple
(LCM) and Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).

- `Least Common Multiple (LCM) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple>`_.
- `Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor>`_.

This is for now a work-in-progress (WIP).
